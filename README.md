#Caesar Cipher Project

Overview

This project is a Python implementation of a simple Caesar Cipher. It allows users to encode or decode messages using a shift cipher technique. The cipher shifts each letter in the text by a specified amount, wrapping around the alphabet as needed.

Features

Encode messages using a Caesar Cipher.

Decode messages to retrieve the original text.

Handles non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, spaces, and symbols) by ignoring them during the encoding/decoding process.

Allows continuous use with an option to exit the program.

Requirements

Python 3.x

art.py file for displaying a logo.

How to Use

Run the Program:
Ensure that art.py is in the same directory as the main program file, and then execute the Python script.

Input Instructions:

Type encode to encrypt a message.

Type decode to decrypt a message.

Provide Message and Shift Value:

Enter the message you want to encode or decode.

Enter a numeric value to determine the shift for the cipher.

View Result:
The encoded/decoded message will be displayed.

Continue or Exit:

Type yes to encode/decode another message.

Type no to exit the program.
